## Brief Description of the Workshop
June 1st â€“ June 5th

In this workshop, we broadly cover 5 modules. The first module focuses on taking a digital design through Xilinx Vivado and programming it on the FPGA. We also demonstrate area, timing analysis, and post-implementation simulation. In the second module, we describe the OpenFPGA framework and demonstrate the VTR tool flow on two designs with an example architecture. Next, we repeat these tasks for a RISC-V based processor called RVMyth. We simulate RVMyth with a testbench through Vivado and program it on a Basys3 board. We then take it through the OpenFPGA framework through Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA). We also demonstrate area, timing analysis, and post implementation simulation for the processor core after taking it through SOFA. Lastly, we summarize the area and timing results obtained by the design from Basys3 and VTR.

 ## FPGA Introduction
 
 ### What Is FPGA And FPGA Architecture?
 
 * **History of Programmable logic**
   * PLA - Programmable logic devices
   * CPLD - Complex Programmable logic devices
   * FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array
   * Generate customizable hardware
   * Study of effects of area, speed, power of the digital circuits
 
 **FPGA Board used in this workshop is Basys3**

  </p>

* **What is an FPGA**
  * A "field programmable" gate array: Integrated circuit designed to be configured by a designer. 
  * FPGA configuration is specified using HDL similar to an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)
  * Logic design in FPGA is different. It uses LUT, Flip-flops, configurable logic blocks.

* **Difference between ASIC and FPGA**

* **Applications**
  * Hardware acceleration
  * Signal Processing
  * Device controllers
  * Embedded systems
  * Aerospace
  * High Performance Computing
  * Machine Learning

* Configurable Logic Blocks (CLB) implement combinatorial and sequential logic. Based on LUT and Flipflop/latches.
  * Look-Up Tables (LUT)which implement logic functions - truth table
  * Carry and Control Logic - Implements arithmetic operations
  * FlipFlops(FF)/Latches
* Memory Elements
* Programmable I/O blocks - Configurable I/Os for external interface connections
* Programmable Interconnect - Wires to connect inputs, CLBs

### Look-up Tables, FPGA Programming And Design Methodology

Lookup Table with N inputs can be used to implement any combinational function of N inputs

### Introduction To Basys FPGA Boards And Vivado

**What are not synthesizable codes**

* Delays #100 - Write counters, and generate a signal after a certain count to create a delay
* Initial block (used only in testbench)
* UDP (User defined primitive) - nmos, pmos
* Runtime/Dynamic Memory Allocation: Indeterminate sizes cannot be synthesised -> Convert into fixed size memory
* Infinite loops -> Convert into a finite loop

**Different ways of programming**
* Local programming on the Basys3 Board
* Remote Programming
  * Inputs through Virtual Inputs/Outputs and Output observed on the board
  * Inputs through Virtual Inputs/Outputs and Output observed on Integrated Logic Analyser (ILA)

## Vivado Counter

### Vivado-Verilog explanation

### Vivado Simulation Elaboration

**Behavioural Simulation result for 4bit Counter**
